Query a Magic the Gathering card database using Prolog. At least, that's the
idea. :-3

Requirements:
- SWI-Prolog
- XML generated by MTGXML (http://projects.flowsnake.org/mtgxml.html)
- Python 2.6 (give or take)

Current status: Very much under construction!  It's more of an experiment than
anything else, by the way.
