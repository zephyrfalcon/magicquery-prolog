# TODO

- There are many more things to extract and to be expressed in rules, like the
  mana cost.

- Add custom rules to a separate Prolog file. For example, we might want
  predicates like:

    cmc(Card, Cost)
    red(Card)  % etc
    has_type(Card, Type)
    has_subtype(Card, Subtype)
    has_rarity(Card, Rarity)
